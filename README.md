# gitSnake
First functional version of the snake game v.1.0

Features included:
- Board with walls
- Pathing betweeen tiles
- Snake follows a color pattern
- Randomly spawning goal
- Title screen
- Game over screen

Future improvements:
- The game shouldn't end when snake is about to collide with the last bit of its tail,
in other words, the snake should be able to move in an O-formation.
- Make obstacles spawn randomly on the board.
- Remove the possibility of moving the snake in the opposite direction it was moving before and
thus colliding with its own body.
